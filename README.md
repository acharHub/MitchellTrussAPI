<h1> Exploring Mitchell Structures </h1>

<p>
To explore Michell structures I developed a custom standalone application using the Processing programming language (Figure 1). The application is a parametric framework that builds discrete Michell trusses in their simple symmetric form. A problem most commonly known as a three-point problem: a discrete optimum truss supported by two fixed points fixed on a vertical line and a vertical point load position in the centered between the elevations of the supports (Figure 2).
