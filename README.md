<h1> Exploring Mitchell Structures </h1>

It uses the <a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing API</a> for graphic elements, rendering and GUI objects. This implementation builds upon a geometric solution of discrete Mitchell trusses in their simple symmetric form: a discrete optimum truss supported by two fixed points (positioned along the same vertical line) and a vertical point load positioned in between the supports at a fixed distance.
